The dataset consisted of 8,525 subjects (17,050 eyes) from Tianjin (region=1) and 8,184 subjects (16,368 healthy eyes) from Shandong (region=2). 
The eyes of each subject were measured by a Pentacam HR system (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany).
For the position of pupil center, Cartesian coordinates (x, y) were converted to polar coordinates (r,Î¸) based on corneal topography.
