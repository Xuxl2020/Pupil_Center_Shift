# Data information
The dataset consisted of 8,525 subjects (17,050 eyes) from Tianjin (region=1) and 8,184 subjects (16,368 healthy eyes) from Shandong (region=2). 
# Pupil measurement
The eyes of each subject were measured by a Pentacam HR system (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany).
# Data transformation
For the position of pupil center, Cartesian coordinates (x, y) were converted to polar coordinates (r,Î¸) based on corneal topography. 
# Data analysis
Directional statistics were used to analyze pupil center position on the polar coordinate system.
